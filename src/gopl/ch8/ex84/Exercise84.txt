Exercise 8.4: Modify the reverb2 server to use a sync.WaitGroup per connection to count the number of
active echo goroutines. When it falls to zero, close the write half of the TCP connection as described in
Exercise 8.3. Verify that your modified netcat3 client from that exercise waits for the final echoes of multiple
concurrent shouts, even after the standard input has been closed.
